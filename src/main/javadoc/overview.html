This SDK contains all the tools you need to build a painlessly network connected app with java. It's primarily meant for 
inclusion in StackMob's Android SDK, but can be used by itself anywhere java is supported, including on the desktop. 
<p>
To learn how to build an Android app with StackMob, check out <a href="https://stackmob.com/platform/start">Getting Started</a>. You can find tutorials and demos in our
<a href="https://stackmob.com/devcenter/">Dev Center</a>. If you're looking for traditional javadocs, some good places to start are {@link com.stackmob.sdk.model.StackMobModel} and
{@link com.stackmob.sdk.model.StackMobUser} for the core data abstractions of the sdk and {@link com.stackmob.sdk.api.StackMob} for global and low-level functionality
